# Prompt Engineering Guide

## What is a Prompt?

A prompt is a piece of natural language text that serves as instructions for a generative AI model. It outlines the task the AI should perform and provides context to guide its response.

## What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering is the process of crafting and iterating on prompts to improve the accuracy, effectiveness, and creativity of a generative AI model's output. It involves:

- **Choosing the right format:** Is it a question, command, or something else?
- **Selecting appropriate phrasing:** Using clear and concise language.
- **Providing relevant context:** Giving the AI background information to understand the task better.
- **Specifying the desired style:** Formal, informal, humorous, etc.
- **Assigning a role to the AI:** "Act as a customer service representative" or "Write from the perspective of a historical figure."
